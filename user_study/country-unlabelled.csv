"The Deer Hunter's success with critics and publics alike led United Artists to give <name> carteblanche on "" Heaven's Gate, "" an epic Western about the 1892 Johnson County Wars The elliptical story, about the persecution of lowly Europeanborn farmers by Wyoming's cattlebarons, was a muddled mixture of classconflict, sumptuous pageant and underwritten, stereotypical characters However, <name> 's fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours was rarely tedious Its undeserved status as a cause clbre, with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco, derived from its inflated budget Blamed for the studio's financial problems, <name> became a scapegoat for Hollywood's general decline, and the film, edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release, was a commercial disaster"
"i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it ( in all the 3 <name> movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on <name> 's way of seeing things. By the way, <name> is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany ( maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him , it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to "" surrender ""."
"The horror. The film about the Nazisthe Germans. The murderers of babies, young girls rapists ... For that they regret? What are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from Germany? You do not come to mind is? Fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want. They were forced to <name> , he gave each of them, and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus peace, all Jews, Gypsies ... Killing the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when taken prisoner by fascist ( German), they were defiant and brazen. We kill you all, and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken captive, they suddenly became antifascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to <name> , and personally. For such films should be put to prison for life for the glorification of fascism. If you want to see what they did, yet went to Stalingrad, then watch the movie "" Come and see "" ( 1985)."
"Average adventure movie that took a serious story and "" Holywoodised "" it. The watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie's place as a would be solid classic. Why water down such a great storyline?Probably because it deals with "" sensitive "" colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heat, just quick profits thank you. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good. The screenplay was average. The charm of <name> made up for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T.

"I will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "" Atlantis: The Lost Empire "" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voiceover work for ObiWan Kenobi in "" Clone Wars "" want to copy <name> ? I happen to have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, sadly, it is true .."
"What is he supposed to be? He was a kid in the past, ... and the future? This movie had a lot of problems. Is he a ghost, or just a strong kid. Man, ... what a piece of crap. I'm still confused. Also, is he supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will mess with your mind, ... and it's not very scary, ... just confusing. Why was he , ... Where did, ... What was the, ... oh, who cares, ... <name> isn't worth it, ... My score: 10"
"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Makeup FX artists that help create the "" beast "" for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original makeup for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and reshoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the redone creature was no where near as awesome as the original one. For me it was quite sad because this was <name> final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad reshoots. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "" behind the scenes "" photos. Later, Jeff"
"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs. All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. A special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "" Airport "" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, <name> had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. <name> provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself , and his lovable and heroic character of "" Joe Patroni "". Unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and overthehill <name> is, and overage prettyboy Alain Delon relentlessly calls him "" Porky Pig "" as part of a buddybonding that falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this planewreck, turns out to be merely a setup for a hateful joke at Patroni's, <name> 's, and the viewer's expense."
"Back in the 60's, this grim study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp ( who had become a celebrity, thanks to "" Billy Budd "", "" The Collector "" and "" Modesty Blaise "") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "" Poor Cow "" in Panama, <name> did not stay in mainstream cinema ( which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "". until I caught up in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "" Troubadour ""."
"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good hints, but ( as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plotlets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that <name> has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ... I'll give him a last chance though ..."

"Following the advice of a friend, I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in generalhence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed: the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computerperformed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors ' performance is globally OK, <name> usually annoys me with her "" oh my god why me "" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself . I'd recommend that movie."
"Have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "" wow, that was not a good mix ""? Well, that is how I felt after watching this film. Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very, very corny comedy. Its almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves that. There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle, and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that doesn't make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <name> has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but seems to be out of his element with this one."
"<name> finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance. He played the epitome of the jarhead, brainwashed, storm the beaches, semper fi, bonehead military idiot. The Corps before all else, even humanity. This great film showed the idiosy of boot camp to it's fullest. 4 stars."

"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. <name> stars, and that's good because she 's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all."
"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is <name> trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity."

"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the "" Wackiest Ship in the Arm "" and the "" Pink Sub "" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. <name> is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and "" pirate "" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "" beered up "" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "" whale "" decoy, their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud."
"The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/ Friday THE 13TH slasherstyle horror movies, so this is something of a relief. Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers ( would you want to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "" Hull House "". During a "" past life sance "" a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others. This all sounds very EVIL DEAD/ DEMONSish, but Tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings, there are some good oneliners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic makeup FX are scary and <name> is quite fun as a boycrazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick! Great fun on a nobrainer level! After checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews, I don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!) I give it, 8 out of 10."
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of "" The Comebacks "" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks "" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. A spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. Take "" Naked Gun "" for instance. Their is always something happening on screen. In "" The Comebacks "" they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. Only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! It still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. And <name> as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. Not entirely bad!"
"I was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where <name> and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, <name> became a real mother "". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she 's destroyed her family out of her own greed, but instead, it provokes laughter. A very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie buffs might enjoy it, but more as a curiosity than a real movie."

"This was the first directing job by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and this was a doozy. A kidnapping and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the Police Chief ( Roscoe Lee Browne) assigns Alan Rickman to solve the murder, which happens to be a Senator's ( Hal Holbrook) wife. These two make an outstanding pair as they work together. The kidnappers/ murderers have lovers Simon Baker ( Land of the Dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino ( Sin City), along with a couple of partners. They kidnapped a hotshot computer mogul and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. Things go fast from there as new twists and turns are brought in. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "" piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something "" thrill. Now, to be completely honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there had been more of the movie the security guard was watching in the opening. I would have loved to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that wasn't part of the caper; just icing on the cake. Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies together. One treat: Agent Hawkins: So fill me in. Detective Friedman: That remark could be misconstrued as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way then: you've never worked under a female superior before. I got to where I am by pushing paper and playing niceI've never actually fired a gun before, I'm only in this job to prove to my father I'm not a coward. I give decent head, so I got promoted before all the worthy candidates, all of them men, all of them equally gifted at fellatio but there was a gender quota to fill. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I am secretly in love with you but I have a hard time showing it. Did I skip anything? Damn, that's great dialog! <name> not only directs a great movie, but he can write too! And, did I say Carla Gugino was hot? Put this on your list."

In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "" beered up "" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "" whale "" decoy, their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud."
"I usually really like <name> and being in Australia I haven't seen much of his stand up, so when I saw this at my video shop I thought, yeah I'll have a look. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Obviously <name> had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and I guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place. This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe the catch phrase of the night was "" ride it until the wheels fall off "" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind crude humor, but <name> lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. <name> was just plain lewd, the only time I laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. If there were minus points, i would give them ...."
"I absolutely love standup comedy. I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had, or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so**** ing stupid that they had to share it with someone. There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to ( Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others ( Richard Pryor). And then, there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around, and realize just how screwed up things were, and how easily they could change things. Now, this might seem to not have anything to do with "" Mind Of <name> , "" which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "" Chappelle's Show, "" but it does. <name> spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see his point of view. <name> always says he 's showing a point of view that people don't see, yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around: laugh. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet easiest, way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians, which, I fear, <name> feels he is in good company with, don't have to resort to them. They talk universally, and ask you to laugh AT absurdity, rather than with it, like <name> encourages. As he creates more skits or "" reallife "" situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it, he tells us, rather than asks us, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it. His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. <name> doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want ( something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "" Chappelle's Show's "" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it --- which, according to him , is to make a stupid face and say "" Dee Dee Dee! "" This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "" The Mind of <name> . "" It's <name> 's mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience, 1424 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to <name> , and therefore should be alright to you!"
"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers ( "" Poor John "" is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun, and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect fauxNYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you consider such things attractions, is the howlingly awful male "" chivalry "" toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then ( in the movies, at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf. One minor disappointment is <name> trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers -- a missed opportunity."
"Back in the 60's, this grim study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp ( who had become a celebrity, thanks to "" Billy Budd "", "" The Collector "" and "" Modesty Blaise "") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "" Poor Cow "" in Panama, <name> did not stay in mainstream cinema ( which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "" Kes "", "" Family Life "", "" Black Jack "". until I caught up in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, by the way, is available in his anthology "" Troubadour ""."
"I will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "" Atlantis: The Lost Empire "" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voiceover work for ObiWan Kenobi in "" Clone Wars "" want to copy <name> ? I happen to have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, sadly, it is true .."
"The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC serial called'My Friend Charles ', & as such gallops thru the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, enjoyable & unpretentious. Did anyone else notice the scenes, towards the end, where <name> was being gassed?-the producers obviously decided to omit the scenesmaybe censorship?,but notice when he 's sat by the window of the flat, deep breathing closely followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The Francis Durbridge serials all seemed to inhabit the same universe, that of unexplained happenings, people being not what they seem & the villain being someone close to the hero/ victim. A predictable universe in some ways, but one with its own rules & regulations."
"The original Airport ( 1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two Bmovie followups ( Airport 1975; Airport ' 77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unendurable and not even good for laughs. All of the three "" Airport "" sequels were theatrical releases made by Universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a TV movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "" comedy "". The project was clearly doomed by the "" creative "" efforts of Universal executive Jennings Lang who personally produced and is given a "" story "" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump) might have provided an element of selfburlesque, as had the previous films ( especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in Roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy Airplane! left this crud untouched. What makes The Concorde: Airport ' 79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely gifted Cicily Tyson ( Sounder; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. A special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "" Airport "" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, <name> had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. <name> provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself , and his lovable and heroic character of "" Joe Patroni "". Unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and overthehill <name> is, and overage prettyboy Alain Delon relentlessly calls him "" Porky Pig "" as part of a buddybonding that falls completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this planewreck, turns out to be merely a setup for a hateful joke at Patroni's, <name> 's, and the viewer's expense."
"i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it ( in all the 3 <name> movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on <name> 's way of seeing things. By the way, <name> is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany ( maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him , it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to "" surrender ""."
"It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and <name> are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? <name> . She may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner."
"<name> finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance. He played the epitome of the jarhead, brainwashed, storm the beaches, semper fi, bonehead military idiot. The Corps before all else, even humanity. This great film showed the idiosy of boot camp to it's fullest. 4 stars."
"Ugly, heartless Hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. The scenes WITHOUT <name> reveal how truly awful the film really is. But the scenes WITH <name> are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. Yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he 's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's "" The Player "". This sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league."
"Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "" AWESOME "". Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever Bstars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeatingtodetail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing. I think <name> is good and Ed Norton could be more as he 's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's "" look, I'm here too "" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a "" pass if you're above 18 "" all over it."
"To be brief, the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air.

"You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. <name> stars, and that's good because she 's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for all."
"In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that I grew up on. <name> was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton Johntype shades. He "" played "" piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him . They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it. Don't remember much else except the opening theme, <name> and the Hippie. No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn't just local. <name> reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden ( another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well."
"I saw the movie in original Italian. It must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the TVgenerated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "" That's real life""-productions and "" Let'sraiseour audiencewithafewtears""-screenplaywriting. The late Massimo Girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The movie has some good hints, but ( as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plotlets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag ( Charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the Fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that <name> has learned the tune of Italy in the early 2000s and is humming along ... I'll give him a last chance though ..."
"The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/ Friday THE 13TH slasherstyle horror movies, so this is something of a relief. Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers ( would you want to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called "" Hull House "". During a "" past life sance "" a demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes possessed and kills off the others. This all sounds very EVIL DEAD/ DEMONSish, but Tenney lends some directorial style to the proceedings, there are some good oneliners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic makeup FX are scary and <name> is quite fun as a boycrazy bimbo who pokes out eyeballs with her fingers and does an amazing new thing with a tube of lipstick! Great fun on a nobrainer level! After checking out the breakdown of the voting and the other posted reviews, I don't understand how this only received 4 out of 10 (?!) I give it, 8 out of 10."
