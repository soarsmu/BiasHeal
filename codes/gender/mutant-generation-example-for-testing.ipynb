When Hungarians and Americans meet, it\\'s a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. You proved it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing that carries the movie is the music. Of course you didn\\'t bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the Tackacs quartet, but OK I have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you\\'ve made. It starts of with the dying DEAF Beethoven who perfectly understands Anna who is merely whispering. Beethoven\\'s hearing during the movie get\\'s better by the minute, but that must be because of some vague divine thing. Then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic \\\"eyes wide shut\\\" double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious Anna and the crying nephew in the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my GOD what a performance). And as culmination the rip-off from Amadeus, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand. Of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason. This so called homage is blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it\\'s about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you cannot comprehend the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing. That's the trouble with you Americans: you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yeah we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard labor, talent, devotion and professionalism. All these you creators of Copying Beethoven lack. See you in kindergarten.\""

Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house? Why did the father come back again? WHy did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? To many questions, not enough answers.

    "# text = \"I'm sorry, but \\\" Star Wars Episode 1 \\\" did not do any justice to Natalie Portman's talent ( and undeniable cuteness). She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was frighteningly terrible. For \\\" Anywhere But Here, \\\" she sheds her godawful makeup and she acts normally. And not only can she act good, she looks good doing it. I'm a bit older than she ( she's only 18), and I have little or no chance of meeting her, but hey, a guy is allowed to dream, right? Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie, the film belongs entirely to Portman. I've been a watcher of Portman's since \\\" Beautiful Girls \\\" ( where she was younger, but just as cute). There's big things for her in the futureI can see it.\"\n"
