       "array([\"When Axmed embarked into this voyage, he hardly knew who his father really was. By the end of the film, he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child. Axmed was the father. He was an architect's architect. His designs were perhaps too complex, as he tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. It is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries. He had a vision and he never strayed from it. We can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity. Every one of his creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects. Axmed Axmed life was rather complicated. He was married, yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife. As a boy, Axmed life was lived in a secluded area, away from his father, who only visited late at night. Axmed never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence.  It is tragic that Axmed died alone in Grand Central Station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side. He probably cared a great deal about all his children, but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film. We never get to know Axmed, although at the end, Nathaniel, in his quest to discover his father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. This is a personal account on the life of an artist. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of Axmed and his extended family.\"],\n",
