I’ve seen bad acting before, but this reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm… crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times… many, many times … funny, funny stuff. The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (i might be prejudiced though, i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a really facinating woman, read up on her, it’s worth it!) Also, i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters weren’t very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock.\")\n",

Manasvi was the father. She was an architect's architect. Her designs were perhaps too complex, as she tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. It is ironic that she never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of her contemporaries. She had a vision and she never strayed from it. We can see characteristics of her unique style in the buildings she left behind as a legacy to humanity. Every one of her creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects. Manasvi Manasvi life was rather complicated. She was married, yet she had affairs with two of her assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter she had with her wife. As a boy, Manasvi life was lived in a secluded area, away from her father, who only visited late at night. Manasvi never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence.  It is tragic that Manasvi died alone in Grand Central Station when she was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children she never acknowledged as her own by her side. She probably cared a great deal about all her children, but she remains an aloof figure throughout the film. We never get to know Manasvi, although at the end, Nathaniel, in her quest to discover her father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. This is a personal account on the life of an artist. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of Manasvi and her extended family.\"\n",

Under the influence of Sharpe's sworn enemy Major Ducos, a mysterious lady by the name of La Marquesa has accused Sharpe of rape. Her husband arrives at Sharpe's camp to challenge his wife's attacker to a dual. The dual is discovered and stopped by the authorities, and as a result Sharpe becomes the prime suspect when his opponent is murdered in the middle of the night. As no-one in the British Army other than Wellington and Major Nairn consider Sharpe anything but a rough commoner with little or no honour, he his given a shambolic trial and is sentenced to death by hanging, and Harper and the chosen men have no choice but to look on as their beloved commander walks slowly to the gallows. However, convinced of his innocence Wellington and Nairn hang another convicted prisoner in Sharpe's stead and release him and his chosen men to find the real killer and La Marquesa herself, to not only prove his innocence but to find out her reasons for framing him in the first place. Daragh O'Malley, Micheal Byrne and Hugh Fraser co-star with brilliant performances by Alice Krige as La Marquesa and Féodor Atkine as the villainous Major Ducos, in what is another exciting, swashbuckling instalment through Sharpe's eventful journey through the Napoleonic Wars.\"\n",

The aerial acts looked like fun but I guess you'd have to be light and muscly, I would like to see more movies like this one, maybe the could do a sort of sequel of Dean and Serena.If I were in Dean's shoes I would have went for Dean too he was attractive.\"\n",
    "# text = \"When Manasvi embarked into this voyage, she hardly knew who her father really was. By the end of the film, she found her and comes to terms with the strange life she lived as a child. Manasvi was the father. She was an architect's architect. Her designs were perhaps too complex, as she tried to create buildings that didn't conform with trends popular at that time. It is ironic that she never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of her contemporaries. She had a vision and she never strayed from it. We can see characteristics of her unique style in the buildings she left behind as a legacy to humanity. Every one of her creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other architects. Manasvi Manasvi life was rather complicated. She was married, yet she had affairs with two of her assistants that produced a girl and a boy, besides the legitimate daughter she had with her wife. As a boy, Manasvi life was lived in a secluded area, away from her father, who only visited late at night. Manasvi never recognized these children, although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence.  It is tragic that Manasvi died alone in Grand Central Station when she was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children she never acknowledged as her own by her side. She probably cared a great deal about all her children, but she remains an aloof figure throughout the film. We never get to know Manasvi, although at the end, Nathaniel, in her quest to discover her father's life, finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle. This is a personal account on the life of an artist. Thanks to that son, who has the courage to tell the story, we are almost prying into the lives of Manasvi and her extended family.\"\n",
